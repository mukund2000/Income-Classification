# Income-Classification
To classify income of the society in two categories namely above 50k and below 50k through machine learning using the given demographic factors.
The prime goal is to make a machine learning model or to train a binary classifier to predict income of an individual with the help of the given attributes in the primary dataset and to yield the best possible result.

# Motivation
1. The world’s serging level of economic inequality is the main motivation of making this model which is able to deal with the classification among the society and hence make aware of the gap existing in the society for further upliftment through taking the necessary measures.

2. For improving the living standards of the middle class in a developing country like India. It is evident the middle class usually has access to all the factors which are necessary for the upliftment in their living standards i.e. income but they are usually unaware of it.

3. Get an estimation of income classification after the pandemic outbreak of coronavirus and get the suggestive approach in upliftment.

4. In improving the decision making of students who are stuck in the phase to pursue higher education or not by giving their predicted income through the attributes. This can be helpful when the student lacks in economic factors and needs to make an effective decision for the time being.

# Objective
1. Improve the income level of an individual and hence the society by implementing the “development of one development of all” technique.

2. To improve Government’s decision making in implementing different yojanas by providing a classification of the demographic region and hence stating the group(s) it will be affected.

3. to ensure sustainable development and improve the economic stability of a nation. 

# Conclusion
1. Only about 1/3 of the population at the time would be considered high income while 2/3 of the population was making less than 50,000 USD per year.

2. The greatest percentage of Asians were making over 50K with White class following close behind.

3. Capital Gain was a good indicator of wealth with a pretty clear separation of people making higher than 50k with higher capital gain which is an indicator of the wealth gap in the US starting to grow.

4. Capital Loss was a mixture of both high income and low-income individuals and not a clear indicator of wealth.

5. Education was a pretty good indicator of income with the highest percentage of high-income individuals finishing a PhD, Masters, or Bachelor's degree. The majority of the population had either a high school degree and / or some college finished.

6. Married people had the highest percentage of high-income people with husbands making up the majority of the workforce.

7. The male working market more than doubled the female working market in 1994.

8. The male dominant job was Craft-repair whereas the female dominant job was Adm-clerical.
